# PortfolioProject1

Heyyy! This is my first portfolio! I hope it showcases my abilitys to perform as an data analyst!

I will do a brief explanation about what each project consisted and which skills I intend to showcase.

## Excel_Project

On this project the dataset was about bike sales of a bikeshop. My goal was to clean the data to avoid errors and make it acessible for the viewers to understand it. 
After cleaning the data, I did some pivot tables so I could understand better the preferences of our clients. After creating the pivot table i transformed the information into charts,
so it was easier to understand the information visually. At last i created slicers so the bike owners could adapt the information for their needs if other questions arised from seeing
the orginal charts.

Unfortunaly I couldn't showcase my ability to use XLOOKUP on this project but im working on a new one that I will showcase that skill!
