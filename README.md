# PortfolioProject1

Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio. I'm thrilled to showcase my work as a data analyst! This is my first-ever portfolio, and I hope it captures what I can do.

I'll give you a quick overview of each project and what I wanted to highlight.

## Excel_Project

In this project, I dealt with data about bike sales at a shop. My job was to clean up the data to make it easy to understand and spot any issues. After tidying up the data, I used pivot tables to figure out customer preferences. Then, I turned these findings into charts to make things visually clear. I also added slicers to make it user-friendly, allowing people to adjust the charts as needed. 

You'll find the original data in the "bike_buyers" sheet. The "WorkingSheet" has the cleaned data, "PivotTable" has my pivot tables, and "Dashboard" shows a dynamic dashboard I created.

While I couldn't showcase my skills with XLOOKUP here, I'm working on a new project that will let me do just that!

## PowerBI_Project

For this project, I used data from a survey of data professionals. It had intriguing info like job happiness, salaries, favorite tools, and more. You can check out the original data in "Power BI_Final Project_Raw" and compare it with the final results in "PowerBI_project."

I performed several data-cleaning activities on this dataset. For example, I cleaned up the data by removing unnecessary data and making it more organized. I also calculated average salaries and added them as a new column. The coolest part? I made an interactive dashboard in "Report View" so you can play around with it.

## SQL_Project_Cleaning

The "SQL_Data_Cleaning_Raw" dataset concerns Nashville Housing and includes information on property owners, sale prices, property addresses, and more. This dataset is offered for reference, providing an unaltered source for examination.

By employing SQL, I undertook data-cleaning processes to enhance our understanding of the dataset and rectify inconsistencies such as duplicates.

## SQL_Project_Data_Exploration
I engaged with a project that centered around a dataset encompassing Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths and Vaccinations. You can access the dataset via the provided [link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

To show my proficiency in utilizing JOIN statements, I bifurcated the original dataset into two separate files. One file is dedicated to Deaths data, while the other encapsulates vaccination-related details. If these files are of interest, let me know, and I can share them because their size it's bigger than the upload Github max.

The query's purpose was to conduct data exploration, enabling an enhanced understanding of the Covid situation across various timeframes and locations. This exploration journey was fortified by the construction of a CTE (Common Table Expression), culminating in the establishment of a View.

## Tableau_Project

For this project, I worked with a dataset that focused on Airbnb listings in Washington (USA). The dataset was rich with intriguing details such as the number of bedrooms, pricing, reviews, and more. Leveraging this data, I was able to calculate various metrics including annual revenue, price per bedroom, and more. This information was then translated into interactive graphics using Tableau. These insights could prove invaluable to individuals considering embarking on an Airbnb venture, aiding them in making well-informed choices.
