# PortfolioProject1

Heyyy! Thank you for opening my portfolio! This is my first portfolio! I hope it showcases my abilities to perform as a data analyst!

I will do a brief explanation about what each project consisted of and which skills I intend to showcase.

## Excel_Project

In this project, the dataset was about bike sales at a bike shop. My goal was to clean the data to avoid errors and make it accessible for the viewers to understand. 
After cleaning the data, I did some pivot tables to better understand our client's preferences. After creating the pivot table I transformed the information into charts,
so it was easier to understand the information visually. At last, I created slicers so the bike owners could adapt the information for their needs if other questions arose from seeing
the original charts.

The original dataset is on the bike_buyers sheet. The "WorkingSheet" has the data cleaned, the "PivotTable" has the pivot tables that I created, and the "Dashboard" sheet 
shows the interactive dashboard that I created.

Unfortunately, I couldn't showcase my ability to use XLOOKUP on this project but I'm currently working on a new one that will showcase that skill!

## PowerBI_Project

This data comes from a survey with data professionals. There is some really interesting data, like happiness levels with work, average salary, industry, favorite programming tool, etc.

I added the Power "BI_Final Project_Raw" so you can see the original data and compare with the final result on the PowerBI_project".

I performed some data-cleaning activities on this dataset. I deleted unnecessary columns; split columns by delimiter and comma to make the information clearer and deleted the confusing parts; I calculated
the average salary and created a new column with that information. After the data cleaning, I created an interactive dashboard on the "Report view" so it adjusts to your needs.
