# PortfolioProject1

Heyyy! Thank you for opening my portfolio! This is my first portfolio! I hope it showcases my abilities to perform as a data analyst!

I will do a brief explanation about what each project consisted of and which skills I intend to showcase.

## Excel_Project

In this project, the dataset was about bike sales at a bike shop. My goal was to clean the data to avoid errors and make it accessible for the viewers to understand. 
After cleaning the data, I did some pivot tables to better understand our client's preferences. After creating the pivot table I transformed the information into charts,
so it was easier to understand the information visually. At last, I created slicers so the bike owners could adapt the information for their needs if other questions arose from seeing
the original charts.

The original dataset is on the bike_buyers sheet. The "WorkingSheet" has the data cleaned, the "PivotTable" has the pivot tables that I created, and the "Dashboard" sheet 
shows the interactive dashboard that I created.

Unfortunately, I couldn't showcase my ability to use XLOOKUP on this project but I'm currently working on a new one that will showcase that skill!

## PowerBI_Project

This data comes from a survey with data professionals. There is some really interesting data, like happiness levels with work, average salary, industry, favorite programming tool, etc.

I added the Power "BI_Final Project_Raw" so you can see the original data and compare it with the final result on the PowerBI_project".

I performed some data-cleaning activities on this dataset. I deleted unnecessary columns; split columns by delimiter and comma to make the information clearer and deleted the confusing parts; I calculated
the average salary and created a new column with that information. After the data cleaning, I created an interactive dashboard on the "Report view" so it adjusts to your needs. 


## SQL_Project_Cleaning

This dataset was about Nashville Housing (Owners, Sale prices, Property Addresses, etc). I added the original dataset if you are interested in seeing the file as "SQL_Data_Cleaning_Raw". 

I performed data cleaning processes in this file in SQL, so we could understand better the data and fix some errors (Duplicates for example).


## SQL_Project_Data_Exploration

The dataset used for this project was about Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths and Vaccinations. The link for the dataset used is [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

For demonstrating that I could use JOINS statements on this project, I created 2 separate files from de original one. One of them contains information about the Deaths and the other the vaccination information.
If needed please ask me and I will send the 2 CSV files (I couldn't upload the files due to the huge size of them).

As you can see on the query, it was performed some data exploration to make it possible to understand better the Covid situation in different periods and locations. I created a CTE and a View at the end.
