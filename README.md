# PortfolioProject1

Heyyy! Thank you for opening my portfolio! This is my first portfolio! I hope it showcases my abilities to perform as a data analyst!

I will do a brief explanation about what each project consisted of and which skills I intend to showcase.

## Excel_Project

In this project, the dataset was about bike sales at a bike shop. My goal was to clean the data to avoid errors and make it accessible for the viewers to understand. 
After cleaning the data, I did some pivot tables to better understand our clients' preferences. After creating the pivot table I transformed the information into charts,
so it was easier to understand the information visually. At last I created slicers so the bike owners could adapt the information for their needs if other questions arose from seeing
the original charts.

Unfortunately I couldn't showcase my ability to use XLOOKUP on this project but im working on a new one that I will showcase that skill!
